							<p>What is this site?</p>
							<p>It recommends games you might be interested in from what your friends on Steam have recently played</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Why we have this site?</p>
							<p>Everyday new game is born and they all looks so awesome. The comments and recommendation online are so un-reliable and biased. It is painful to get the right games from those recommendations.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Then why we can get right games from this site?</p>
							<p>People only spend time on things they love to do. When your friends play hundreds of hours on a new game, there is no doubt to try it out. Our site only recommend the games your friends love, and you are most likey to be interested in.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>OK, sounds good, but what is Steam?</p>
							<p>Steam is a gaming platform. If you don't have a Steam account, go <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">there</a> to register one. Millions of people are playing on Steam everyday. It is an awesome place for gaming. Certainly, this site has nothing to do with Steam company. It is not for commercial-purpose.</p>
